Gene Signature Evaluation and Refinement
===
This project contains data and code for the evaluation and refinement of FSHD gene signatures.

## Main Results

#### Evaluate Discriminative Power of Combined Signature

![figure1](figures/Combined%20signature.png)

- ROC-AUC of the combined signature
- Model: Random Forest
- Scoring metric: 20 times 5-fold repeated stratified cross-validation

#### Refinement of FSHD Gene Signatures

![figure2](figures/Refined%20signature.png)

- Model: Random Forest + Boruta Feature Selection
- 13 genes selected from combined gene signatures

#### Exploratory Analysis for FSHD Gene Signatures

![figure3](figures/Exploratory%20signature.png)

- Select based on Correlation + ANOVA F
- 30 genes selected from all genes
